# A small library containing methods that allow you to work faster with [Adventure](https://github.com/KyoriPowered/adventure) library elements.

Some usage references provided here: [StyleUtils](https://github.com/xw1w1/StyleUtils/blob/main/README.md)
Usage is the same everywhere. You just statically add required class to your project's class imports, and use this library.

//TODO: Create examples
